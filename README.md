## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a trained Data Scientist, I have developed strong expertise in Python, automation, and Machine Learning. Over 4+ years at RES Group, I designed and deployed solutions that optimized asset supervision, reduced response times, and replaced manual processes.

I developed a real-time tracking system for field interventions, allowing teams across the world to monitor site activity efficiently. To enhance operational insights, I built an automated fault analysis tool leveraging Machine Learning to identify root causes and categorize asset downtimes. I also implemented an alerting system that detects and notifies teams of critical anomalies, improving incident response. Additionally, I designed Power BI dashboards to monitor tool performance and user engagement.

With expertise in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Microsoft Azure, I am passionate about developing impactful solutions that drive automation, efficiency, and data-driven decision-making.
